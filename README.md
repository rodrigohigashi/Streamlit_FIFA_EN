# Project_Streamlit_FIFA
The 2017 to 2023 soccer player dataset provides comprehensive information on professional soccer players. The dataset contains a wide range of attributes, including player demographics, physical characteristics, playing statistics, contract details and club affiliations. With over 17,000 records, this dataset offers a valuable resource for soccer analysts, researchers and enthusiasts interested in exploring various aspects of the soccer world, as it allows them to study player attributes, performance metrics, market valuation, club analysis, player positioning and player development over time. The home page features a presentation of the dashboard, along with a link to the database used. The players page shows some information about the players, such as their photo, name, age, height, weight, club they belonged to at the time, market value, weekly salary and termination clause. On the teams page we have the clubs and their respective badges, players and their information.
